# Visualization

The reason of why visualization is relevant with cloud computing and bigdata is quite straightforward: no one want to read the raw bigdata line by line to understand it.

This time no Azure or system relevant techniques involved.

So, honestly the introductions of some popular JS libraries are in much better quality than what I could do in this area.

Moreover, given that you are capable to implement dynamic webpages, you should already have all the required knowledge.

If you would like some hints from me, I'd say, please search "Chart JS libraries" and the top 1 in the result list will do the job (the one appeared in my search engine is https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/Links to an external site. ).
